Intelligence Imbued Onchain in Non-fungible Technology

## Why NFTs and AI? 

The future trajectory of the non-fungible space will be built by teams focused on the core, foundational aspects that create real value and utility for non-fungible technology to flourish. These are: 

1. Transparency
2. Immutability
3. Ownership
4. Access

By providing the access via scaling solutions, ownership via self-custody and onchain proof through unique digital assets, immutable contracts, and transparent code as to how smart contracts will behave in all circumstances, AI and NFTs form the potential for the next big breakthrough, akin to only the PFP mania that ensued in 2021. Except this time, the utility that can be built is not only sustainable, but can become **ever** more value over time, thanks to the vast capabilities of ever-optimizing machine learning algorithims and data science. We plan to be a leader in this space for many years to come, and NFT avatars, personalized to users will be a primary strategy in on-boarding new users to not just NFTEarth, but web3 in general.
